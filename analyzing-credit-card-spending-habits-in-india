--Dataset taken from Kaggle

--Describinng dataset 
  --We have 7 columns in the dataset, 
      -- Index, City, Date, Card Type, Expensed Type, Gender, Amount

--All these problems are solved using Postgres SQL 

-- Step 1: Create the database
Create database sql-project;

-- Step 2: Create table definition
CREATE TABLE credit_card_transactions(
transactions_id bigint,
city varchar(200),
transaction_date varchar(200),
card_type varchar(200),
exp_type varchar(200),
gender varchar(200),
amount bigint);

-- Step 3: Import csv data into postgres table
COPY PUBLIC."credit_card_transaction" FROM 'file_path' Delimiter ',', CSV HEADER;

--step 4: Successfully loaded the data into the table
select * from credit_card_transactions;

Step 5: Understanding the dataset
--Understanding categories of expense type bills:
select exp_type, count(1) as transactions_based_on_bills
from credit_card_transactions
group by exp_type;

--Total Records
select count(1) from credit_card_transactions;

--Understanding unique cards
select card_type, count(1) as trnascations_based_on_each_card
from credit_card_transactions
group by card_type;

--Understanding total cities in India
select city, count(1) as total_transactions_from_each_city
from credit_card_transactions
group by city;


--Problems Try to tried  to answer using SQL 
1- write a query to print top 5 cities with highest spends and their percentage contribution of total credit card spends 



2- write a query to print highest spend month and amount spent in that month for each card type
3- write a query to print the transaction details(all columns from the table) for each card type when
it reaches a cumulative of 1000000 total spends(We should have 4 rows in the o/p one for each card type)
4- write a query to find city which had lowest percentage spend for gold card type
5- write a query to print 3 columns:  city, highest_expense_type , lowest_expense_type (example format : Delhi , bills, Fuel)
6- write a query to find percentage contribution of spends by females for each expense type
7- which card and expense type combination saw highest month over month growth in Jan-2014
9- during weekends which city has highest total spend to total no of transcations ratio 
10- which city took least number of days to reach its 500th transaction after the first transaction in that city
